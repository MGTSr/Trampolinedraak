# Trampolinedraak

This game is being developed as an experiment. We, at home, really love the Jackbox games, where you start the game on the computer and use your smartphones/tablets as the game controllers. But, as always, we wanted more! So I am creating a framework for these kinds of games, hosted on a free Heroku server, and will build my own on top of it.

You can access the server [here](https://trampolinedraak.herokuapp.com).

# Build Setup
```bash
# To install, just go to the root folder and run
npm i

# To build the files run
npm run build

# To run as dev
npm run dev

# To run as prod
npm run start
```
